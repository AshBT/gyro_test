October 16, 2013 - This is a proof of concept in need of much improvement. All suggestions welcome. 

SUMMARY:
The objective for this project is to collect motion data and visualize it in 3D space. I'm using a Parallax L3G4200D 3-axis gyroscope attached to an Arduino with an SD shield. The data is written to the card and used to create a simple line representation in 3D in Processing.
